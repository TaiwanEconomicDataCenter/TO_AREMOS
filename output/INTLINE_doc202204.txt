'United States Interest Rates and Bond Yields, Selected Interest Rates, Federal Funds Effective Rate, Not Seasonally Adjusted, Unit: Percent, Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data, Note: (1)Averages of daily figures. nan For additional historical federal funds rate data, please see Daily Federal Funds Rate from 1928-1954 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33951). (2)The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target.(2) The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal funds target rate. As previously stated, this rate influences the effective federal funds rate through open market operations or by buying and selling of government bonds (government debt).(2) More specifically, the Federal Reserve decreases liquidity by selling government bonds, thereby raising the federal funds rate because banks have less liquidity to trade with other banks. (3)Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying government bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have excess liquidity for trade. Whether the Federal Reserve wants to buy or sell bonds depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target to temper economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a lower federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity. (4)Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and foreign exchange markets. (5)The federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S. (6)financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2) References (1) Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Depository institutions are not required to seek alternative sources of funds before requesting advances of primary credit. Primary credit may be used for any purpose, including financing the sale of federal funds. By making funds readily available at the primary credit rate the primary credit program complements open market operations in the implementation of monetary policy. (2)Reserve Banks ordinarily do not require depository institutions to provide reasons for requesting very short-term primary credit. Rather, borrowers are asked to provide only the minimum information necessary to process a loan, usually the amount and term of the loan. (3)This rate replaces that for adjustment credit, which was discontinued after January 8, 2003. For further information, see Board of Governors announcement (https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2002/200210312/).

(31 Dec 1995) (2)National & Provincial Building Society transferred its business to Abbey National plc; its data are now included within the banking sector rather than the building society sector. Flows have been adjusted for the change in both sectors populations; levels data shown here are not break adjusted. In connection with this, M4 was boosted by some £0.9bn of deposits. (31 Aug 1996) (3)Separate intra-group transactions by two banks are estimated to have boosted the one month growth rate of M4 lending by 0.2pp, with a possible positive impact on M4 in November. One of these transactions was unwound in December. (30 Nov 1996 - 31 Dec 1996) (4)It is estimated that some £5bn (nsa) of the fall in wholesale M4 reflected the run-down of gilt repo activity over the calendar year-end; this was unwound in January. (31 Dec 1996 - 31 Jan 1997) (5)Alliance & Leicester Building Society converted to public limited company status; its data are now included within the banking sector rather than the building society sector. Flows have been adjusted for the change in both sectors populations; levels data shown here are not break adjusted. (30 Apr 1997) (6)Halifax Building Society converted to public limited company status; its data are now included within the banking sector rather than the building society sector.

Flows have been adjusted for the change in both sectors populations; levels data shown here are not break adjusted. (31 Jul 1997) (8)Banks amounts outstanding have been affected by the introduction of the new banking statistics returns, in particular the reclassification of the Channel Islands and Isle of Man as non-residents. (30 Sep 1997) (9)Northern Rock Building Society converted to public limited company status; its data are now included within the banking sector rather than the building society sector. Flows have been adjusted for the change in both sectors populations; levels data shown here are not break adjusted. (31 Oct 1997) (10)The one-month growth rate of wholesale M4 included an unusual positive contribution equivalent to some 1.4pp (sa). (31 May 1999) (11)The one-month growth rate of wholesale M4 was depressed by 1.4pp (sa) due to the reversal of the unusual transaction which boosted wholesale M4 by the same amount in May. (30 Jun 1999) (12)The growth of total M4 was boosted by at least £4 bn (nsa), in part by transactions associated with Lloyds TSBs acquisition of Scottish Widows and corporate cash management activity in advance of payments due in early September for UK third generation mobile phone licences. (31 Aug 2000) (13)M4 was depressed by 0.2pp as a result of the unwinding of corporate cash management activity that took place in August 2000 (30 Sep 2000) (14)M4 was boosted by £2.6bn in September 2004 as a result of changes in the way a group is managing its interest rate risk ahead of the move to International Accounting Standards (IAS). (30 Sep 2004) (15)Following the transition of building societies statistical reporting from the FSA to the Bank of England on 1 January 2008, some minor changes to the building societies contribution to the calculation of M4 and M4 lending have been implemented.  The effects of these have been removed from the flows data, and are small in terms of the amounts outstanding. (31 Jan 2008) (16)From April 2009 data onwards, banks and building societies own covered bond entities are treated as part of the bank or building society. Positions between banks/building societies and their covered bond entities are netted out. This led to a £21 billion fall in the amount outstanding of M4. These effects have been removed from the flows (changes) data. (30 Apr 2009) (17)As a result of accounting changes at some institutions, the amount outstanding of this series has decreased by £11bn. The movement has been adjusted out of the flows for January 2010. (31 Jan 2010) (18)Due to changes to reporting of securitised loans, along with related liabilities, the amount outstanding of this series has increased by £176bn.
